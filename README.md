## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd day-task
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Supabase credentials:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

**To get your Supabase credentials:**

2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings â†’ API
4. Copy your Project URL and anon/public key

### 4. Set up the database
Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor to create the tasks table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  text TEXT NOT NULL,
  priority TEXT CHECK (priority IN ('high', 'medium', 'low')),
  category TEXT CHECK (category IN ('personal', 'work', 'shopping', 'health', 'education', 'finance', 'home', 'travel')),
  completed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  notes TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Disable RLS for development (or set up proper policies for production)
ALTER TABLE tasks DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### 5. Start the development server
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.

## Security Notes

- Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- The `.env.example` file is provided as a template
- For production, consider implementing proper Row Level Security policies
- Consider adding user authentication for multi-user support
